### ü§î What is COYL?

Have you ever felt like you're living through a specific "chapter" of your life? COYL is a web application designed to capture that feeling. It's a personal, visual dashboard that helps you:

* **Define Your Current Chapter:** Give a name to the period of your life you're in right now.
* **Connect with Archetypes:** Choose a symbolic location and a personal symbol that resonate with where you are on your journey.
* **Visualize Your Time:** See a live countdown of the days remaining in your current year of life, and the days that have passed, reminding you to make each one count.
* **Stay Inspired:** Get a daily stoic quote to keep you grounded and motivated.

It‚Äôs a private space to see your life's narrative unfold in a creative and meaningful way.

### üíñ Why Was This Project Created?

I've always had this idea of viewing life through a more epic, story-driven lens. We all have powerful symbols and mental "locations" that define our inner state, but it's easy to lose track of them in the hustle of daily life.

I wanted to create an easily accessible, beautiful visual that could capture my mental and emotional state, using the power of archetypes. It‚Äôs dynamic, it changes as you change, but it‚Äôs always there to remind you of your story, your character, and your personal power.

Plus, it was a fun project to build!
